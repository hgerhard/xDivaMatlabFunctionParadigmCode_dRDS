This directory provides more information about the exact paradigms run in the “3D Threshold” experiments led by Holly Gerhard.


pmf_RDS_Corr_Fig_Variable_Bgr_RB_8bit_Sqr_Cyc.m

was used for baby data collection


pmf_RDS_Corr_Fig_Variable_Bgr_RB_8bit_SquareOpt.m

was used for early versions of adult data collection



The only difference is that the baby version has the additional option for picking the thickness of the cyclopean bars (i.e. how many cycles/deg. the bars are). The cleaner version in pmf_dRDS_correlatedFigure_variableBackgrd.m includes functionality to reproduce any type of experiment that was run.


The subdirectories here list example stimuli information for each paradigm run. The associated *.mat variables are not included here for space considerations, but they are available on internal SVNDL servers (available only for internal users).
